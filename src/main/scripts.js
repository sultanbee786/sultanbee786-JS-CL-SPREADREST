/**
 * Recall that the spread/rest operator (...) serves two purposes. First it "spreads", that is it breaks apart a collection like an array
 * into individual elements. Secondly it takes in the "rest", meaning that when used to modify a parameter, we take any number of remaining parameters
 * and combine them into an array. Using this operator in these ways will allow you to complete the exercise below.
 * 
 * There are several functions here, you will only need to make changes to the first two, submitEmployee() and sum(). 
 * 
 * For submitEmployee() you will need to make sure the call to renderEmployee() is properly invoked so that the employee profile is correctly rendered.
 * 
 * For sum() you will need to make sure the function can handle the parameters given to it, and use a for loop to sum them up.
